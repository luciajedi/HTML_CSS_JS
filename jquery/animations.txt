Create and animate, with JQuery and CSS animations:

- a div that rotates around vertical axis (Y) and each time it rotates it changes its photo/background
- a div that goes big and small (with buttons for example)
- a div that moves in circles
- a div that fades out (disappear), with a button or with a timer
