#### URL Encode

In a website we can set its charset to define the character encoding of the letters we will use (for example, for chinese the charset is "utf-8", that is pretty universal, but for catalan it is "ISO-8859-1").

Nevertheless, sometimes we will find strange numbers instead of letters in text or URLs. It is called URL Encoding.
